# Python review function introduction

### Problem 1
Create a ```printNumbers``` function to print integers from -25 to 20 to the console (print in the function)

### Problem 2
Create a function called checkPassword. Send two string variables to the checkPassword function to check if the strings are equal. Return true if they are equal and false if they are not equal. Print the function's return value.

### Problem 3
Write a function that determines if a number passed to it is odd or even. Pass a number of your choosing (using input a good idea) and then using the result from the function, print if the number was even or not.

examples:
```
The number 12 is an even number!

The number 5 is an odd number!
```
### Problem 4
* Create a function for the challenge that you call from your ```main``` 
* Create a *second* function that takes NO parameters 
* Create a *third* function that takes a single greeting parameter (ex. ```Howdy```) and returns a string using the passed in greeting and 'World' (ex. ```Howdy World!```)
* From your *first* function, call the function(s) and print out the final result returned

### Problem 5:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Challenge
Create a function that accepts 2 numbers. When the function is called return the sum, difference, product, and quotient as 4 separate return values. 

Print the 4 results that are returned using f-strings.

Example: If 2 and 6 are passed into the function, output should be similar to the following:

```
The sum of 2 + 6 is 8
The difference of 2 - 6 is  -4
The product of 2 * 6 is 12
The quotient of 2 / 6 is .333
```
